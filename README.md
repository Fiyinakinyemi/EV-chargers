# EV-chargers
This repository contains the code and data I used in this project, as well as map of the EV stations that I use in my presentation.
The branch labeled Text files w/ data contains the code I used to save data from the NREL API into text files, as well as the text files with the information
The branch labeled Plot Stations Code has the code that I used to read the text file with combined data and plot the points on a Google Map with colors corresponding to the number of chargers at that location
